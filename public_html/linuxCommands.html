    <div class = "introduction"><p> There are various liux commands used repeatedly throughout the course. The commands are listed below
    in order of their difficulty/usefulness.</p></div>
    <ol>
        <li>pwd(Present Working Directory)</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> This command is perhaps the most basic and most used command in linux. It is used to idetify which directory you are in your computer and are running commands from.</p>
            <img src = "./images/pwd.png">
        </div>
        <li>cd(Change Directory)</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> As name suggests, this command is used to change directories.</p>
            <img src = "./images/cd.png">
            <p> Remember: "." matches your current directory, ".." matches your parent directory, and "`" matches your home directory.</p>
        </div>
        <li>ls(List)</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> This command provides a list of everything in your working directory. One could use "$ls -a" where (a) refers to all to show hidden files and folders as well as the path to the current and parent folder.</p>
            <img src = "./images/ls.png">
        </div>
        <li>mkdir(Make Directory)</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> This command created a directory in the current working directory.</p>
            <img src = "./images/mkdir.png">
        </div>
        <li>touch</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> The touch command creates an empty file.</p>
            <img src = "./images/touch.png">
            <p> Notice that touch can create a file of any type. One can also create files using an editor like vi. All of vi is described in another page.</p>
        </div>
        <li>rm(ReMove)</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> This command removes files and folders. However it is safe to use "$rm -r" while deleting folders so that the command calls itself recursively to delete all subfolders.</p>
            <img src = "./images/rm.png">
        </div>
        <li>mv(MoVe)</li>
        <div class = "description">
            <p> This command does two things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Move files/folders.</li>
                <img src = "./images/move.png">
                <li>Rename files/folders.</li>
                <img src = "./images/rename.png">
            </ul>
