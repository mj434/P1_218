        <div class = "subheader">A dictionary of OOP terms</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "introduction"><p>This is a glossary of terms used in Object Oriented Programming.</p></div>
    <ol>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> An approach to designing and building applications that are flexible, natural, well-crafted, and testable by focusing on objects that interact cleanly with one another.</p>
            
        </div>
        <li>Factory</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> A "Factory" is a class that only contains factory methods</p>
            <p>A "Factory method" is a method inside a class that has an interface (or an abstract class) as a return type and constructs objects implementing this interface based on some internal logic.</p>
                   
        </div>
        <li>Instantiation</li>
        <div class = "description"><p> The phrase "instantiating a class" means the same thing as "creating an object." When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Object</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>An instance of a class that is created at runtime.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Class</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>The code describing a particular entity in the application, such as Customer, Order, or Address. The class contains the code defining the properties and methods.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Namespace</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Constructor</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>Code that is executed each time an instance of the class is created.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Fixture</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Type hint</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Type cast</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>Typecasting, or type conversion, is a method of changing an entity from one data type to another.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Unit test</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Static</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>In object-oriented programming, there is also the concept of a static member variable, which is a "class variable" of a statically defined class, i.e., a member variable of a given class which is shared across all instances (objects), and is accessible as a member variable of these objects.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Class Method</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class. They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Facade</li>
        <div class = "description"><p>A facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.</p>
        </div>
